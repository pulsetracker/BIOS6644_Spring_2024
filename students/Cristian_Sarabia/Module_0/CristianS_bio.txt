My name is Cristian Sarabia, I completed my MPH back in 22', and since then I have been working as a PRA at the College of Nursing here on campus. I work with a lot of data from creating data collection tools, storing and managing data, and assiting a statistician using SAS. With all this exposure I am interested in focusing my career on data science.
