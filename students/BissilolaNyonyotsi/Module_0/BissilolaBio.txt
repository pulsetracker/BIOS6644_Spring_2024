My name is Bissilola Nyonyotsi and I go by Lola. I am a Masters student in the Biostatistics Program and currently work at the Veterans Affairs as a student data analyst. I am focused on understanding benefits of inpatient physical therapy among patients diagnosed  with heart failure. In my spare time, I love cooking, painting and watching comedies movies.
