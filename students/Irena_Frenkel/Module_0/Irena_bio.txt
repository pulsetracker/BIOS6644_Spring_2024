Hello! I’m Irena. I’m a student in the MPH in Applied Biostatistics program at the Colorado School for Public Health. While in school, I have continued to work as a clinical microbiologist in a hospital lab, but soon after graduating, I plan to pivot to a career in public health data science.  I grew up in Aurora, Colorado and some of my hobbies include backpacking, snowboarding, and rock climbing.
