Hello, my name is Vince. I'm a PharmD postdoc and am currently on my second year of fellowship. 

I primarily study antiviral pharmacology but have done adherence tracking and "digital health" research as 

well. I've had some experince data wrangling in Rstudio but none with python. I'm excited to get started, thanks!
