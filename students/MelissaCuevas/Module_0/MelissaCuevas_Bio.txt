MelissaCuevas Bio

Just a person who works in a lab and doesn't know how to use git or code.. yet.
Also a lego fanatic and origami master. 
I lived in Indonesia for the first 10 years of my life, moved to Louisiana, and came to CO two major hurricanes later. I went to high school in a little town called Fruita. I met my husband in middle school. We have an orange cat named Oliver and a pitbull named Barley.
