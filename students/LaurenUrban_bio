Hello, everyone! 
My name is Lauren and I am an Applied Biostatistics MPH student. 
My academic/professional areas of interest are clinical trials and data visualization.
I'm originally from Buffalo, NY and moved to Colorado for school (the mountains are cool too)
I love to travel, the daily Connections (iykyk), movies, and hiking
Looking forward to a great semester :)
