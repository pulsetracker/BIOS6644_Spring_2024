## High Level Course Overview
 - 2x/week meeting:  M/W
 - Structured around ~6 common problem types (flexible depending on our speed)
 - As much as possible, mimic real life
	 - Use all resources 
	 - Turn in your own solutions
 - "Lectures" are mostly demonstrations of various features and "gotchas" of Python
 - Each will have an "activity" which walks you through an approach for dealing with that kind of problem
 - Final Project -- Ideally will be from your research/job/hobby
