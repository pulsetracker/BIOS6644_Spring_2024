Hello class! My name is Joely (she/her), and I am in my final semester in the MPH Epidemiology program. 
I grew up in Northern California, and have been working as an emergency medical technician in Denver for the last 3 years. 
After graduation, I hope to work in the field of epi, but would also love to find a way to incorporate patient care/interfacing into this.
