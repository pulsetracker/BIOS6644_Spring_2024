Hello,
My name is Alina Sanchez. I was born and raised in San Jose, CA and moved here in August for my MPH. I would say I am pretty novice to coding, and suprisingly my tech skills are lower than I would like. 
I am hoping that after I obtain my MPH I focus further on the Latino population and data as there is a lasck of representation. I am hoping this course will gain me further skills to sue in my future career. 
Additionally, I would like to work as a health care data analyst or clinical data anaylyst in a clinical setting of some sort as some point in my life.
For the most part, I am pretty open to opportunities and I really just care about making impact.
