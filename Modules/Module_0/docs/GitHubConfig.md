# Setting up authenticated GitHub Access over HTTPS protocol

- [ ] Open the following page and select your operating system:
[link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git)
    - This will have you install a github-specific command line tool called gh
- [ ] For Windows users, use powershell or cmd to do the following.  For mac & linux, use the regular terminal
```bash
gh auth login
```
  This will start an interactive script.  I found that the options were sometimes not visible,
  and so had to up/down arrow a few times to see them.  Select the following options:
```
? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host? HTTPS
? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser

! First copy your one-time code:...
```
Copy the code and and paste it into the webpage that pops up and follow the rest of the prompts.

This authorization (done via windows cmd or powershell) will work under git-bash with no extra steps.

## Re-initialize your local repository.
This is not required, but recommended to make sure we're all on the same setup.
```bash
mkdir BIOS6644_GitHub
cd BIOS6644_GitHub
git clone https://github.com/BIOS6644/BIOS6644_Spring_2024.git
```
This will download all the stuff that's there.  Now setup your branch:

```bash
cd BIOS_6644_Spring_2024
git branch Your_Name
git checkout Your_Name
git push git push --set-upstream origin Your_Name # not an typo!  use git push!
```
Now you'll be on your branch locally and github will be aware of your branch.  Now make
a folder for yourself under students.
```bash
cd students
mkdir YourName
cd YourName
mkdir Module_0
touch empty.txt # make an empty file to force git to build the directory tree
```
Now you have a folder structure for submitting your work.

Now we can push this (empty) structure to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m"Initial Commit"

git pull origin main:main  # just in case something has changed

git push

```
Locally, you'll have the folder: 

BIOS6644_GitHub/BIOS6644_Spring_2024/students/Your_Name/Module_0

This is the folder to put Module_0 submissions.
  1. The biography, YourName_Bio.txt
  2. Your work-through of the Python Refresher.  Make sure your name is in the filename: M0_Python_Refresher_Your_name.ipynb

There are really 2 ways to submit the files.   
  1) put the files on your repo (in the folder mentioned above), then push to github
```bash
cp /path/to/your/bio/YourName_Bio.txt BIOS6644_GitHub/BIOS6644_Spring_2024/students/Your_Name/Module_0
cp /path/to/your/notebook/M0_Python_Refresher_Your_name.ipynb BIOS6644_GitHub/BIOS6644_Spring_2024/students/Your_Name/Module_0
git add .
git commit -m"Module 0 submissions"
git push
```
  3) Upload the files via github's web page
    - Dropdown menu--select your branch
    - Navigate to the drop folder
    - Click Add File --> Upload Files
     - Drag & Drop your submissions there
     - Click the commit button.
    Now your files will be on github, but not your local repo.  You can git pull to get them locally.
```bash
git pull
```
